# BYU-I Trust Eat - React App
[Official Website](https://byui-trust-eat.netlify.app/)

# Overview

This is an application designed for 15,000+ BYU-Idaho students, professors, and faculties to use. They can use it to search for restaurants in the Rexburg and Idaho Falls areas. They can also write reviews for these restaurants, and if they want, they can also add a new restaurant to the Home page for others to review. We hope this app will help more BYU-Idaho students know where to go when they want to find a good restaurant.

Even though this is not a real "phone app", we still do **mobile first design** to make it easy for everyone to use on the phone.
